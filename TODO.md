### TODOs

* export get_meta_from_recipe function

* extract impact by recipe (done, with two versions, need to discuss with science which to take going forward)

* calculate impact - only export for method 2a and 2b for other users, as 0 and 1 are too simple (done, attched IU)

* extract aggregated burden by recipe 
 - may be not necessary anymore, as this is output of method0 and method1 already
 - if needed, move burden calculation report here

* add test data
 - pine countries 
 - median runs for central estimates
 - hepb, yf and measles
 
* output templates for external users
IMPACT
 - recipe
 - impact_raw
 - fvps
 IU
 - impact_ratio_raw -> can be generated from IMPACT
 - fvps
 
* IU for internal use

* standardise output to match past data sets - this is only for internal use, no need to export for non-science users
