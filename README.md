## Running tests which rely on PostgreSQL database

Some require a PostgreSQL database. These tests will be skipped by default when running locally. To enable them, run the `./scripts/test_db_start.sh` script to run up a Postgres db within a docker container. When finished testing locally run `./scripts/test_db_stop.sh` to stop the container.

You can connect directly to the Postgres db by running `./scripts/connect_db.sh`
